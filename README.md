ESPectro Blynk Firmware
=======================

Using ESPectro with Blynk with almost no coding required.

### IDE Compatibility

* Arduino IDE
* PlatformIO

### Dependencies

You have to install the following libraries:

* [Blynk](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest)
* [ESPectro](https://github.com/andriyadi/EspX)
* [NeoPixelBus](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus)
* [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager)
* [Adafruit BMP085 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library)

However, if you're familiar with PlatformIO, you only need to download Adafruit's BMP085 Library manually to `lib` directory!
